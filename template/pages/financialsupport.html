        <h3 class="top3">diversity scholarship</h3>
        <p>
          At the end of 2015, the United States PostgreSQL Association unanimously passed a resolution ear-marking $10,000 of funds for our Diversity Scholarship.
          Since then, the Diversity Committee (comprised of Robert Treat, Kris Pennella, Gabrielle Roth and Lacey Williams Henschel) have been working to create
          guidelines around what would be a beneficial program for the PostgreSQL community.
        </p>
        <p>
          We are pleased to announce the application for the Diversity Scholarship is
          <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSe608VQuRZUSQQYnzZRa1ak1w8PSgQ_giCK_rfACaqDSuzYmA/viewform?c=0&w=1">open and available for submissions</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          You can apply to have some or all of your conference attendance costs (registration, hotel, airfare) covered. Just like submitting a talk, details count!
          Your application should include specifics of how attending the event will benefit you, and how you plan to share the benefit with others in the community.
        </p>
          The decision making process will be ranked on 1 (low) to 5 (high) in the following areas:
        <ul>
          <li>benefit to the applicant</li>
          <li>benefit to others (conference attendees, community members, applicant's coworkers, fellow students)</li>
          <li>(subjective) how serious do I feel the applicant is?</li>
          <li>(subjective) what is my overall feeling about the application?</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Each committee member will score applications in random order, without knowing other committee members' scores.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Diversity Committee would like to thank our friends and members of the Django community for allowing us to review and borrow from their program.
